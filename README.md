HTML5 and CSS3: My First Web Page


Those are my first steps in understanding the basic structure of an HTML file. Using the browser to inspect elements. Learning to set styles for elements using CSS.
Also, knowing reset.css and CSS positioning, as well as the difference between inline and block, borders and CSS pseudo-classes.
I used styles for forms, fields and tables. In addition to understanding the hierarchy in CSS and working with transformations and transitions.
Finally, I imported external content into the HTML page, such as fonts, videos, and maps. I used pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. I learned what advanced CSS selectors are, as well as how to employ opacity and shadow. Furthermore, I started studying Viewport and responsive design.
